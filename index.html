      <h2>About the Project</h2>
      <p>
        An artificial pancreas is a life-saving medical device system designed to help individuals with type 1 diabetes by automating insulin delivery. It aims to maintain normal blood glucose levels by continuously monitoring glucose and delivering insulin as needed.
      </p>
      <p>
        Historically, insulin therapy began with injections and evolved to insulin pumps. However, these methods required constant human input. The artificial pancreas integrates continuous glucose monitoring (CGM), smart algorithms, and insulin pumps to automate this process.
      </p>
      <p>
        The goal is to mimic the natural glucose-regulating function of a healthy pancreas. By closing the feedback loop between glucose levels and insulin delivery, it reduces the burden on patients and improves glycemic control.
      </p>
      <p>
        These devices are especially crucial during periods where blood sugar fluctuations are unpredictable, such as during physical activity or sleep. They help prevent both dangerous highs (hyperglycemia) and lows (hypoglycemia).
      </p>
      <p>
        Over time, artificial pancreas systems have become more sophisticated, incorporating smartphone apps, wireless connectivity, and cloud-based data storage for remote monitoring and personalized insights.

      <h2>Working of Artificial Pancreas</h2>
      <p>
        A modern artificial pancreas typically consists of three main parts: a continuous glucose monitor (CGM), an insulin pump, and a control algorithm hosted on a smartphone or other smart device.
      </p>
      <p>
        The CGM sends real-time glucose data to the controller, which calculates insulin dosage using predictive algorithms. The pump then delivers insulin automatically via a cannula.
      </p>
      <p>
        This system is closed-loop, meaning it continuously monitors, analyzes, and reacts without needing frequent manual input. Some also deliver glucagon to prevent hypoglycemia.
      </p>
      <p>
        The control algorithm adapts based on patterns in glucose variation, recent food intake, activity levels, and time of day, offering a dynamic response to the user's needs.
      </p>
      <p>
        Newer systems are equipped with fail-safes and learning capabilities that refine their accuracy over time, making them more reliable for long-term diabetes management.
