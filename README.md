# Artificial Pancreas Portfolio

A biomedical engineering student project that explores the **design, working, and safety standards of artificial pancreas systems** used for managing Type 1 diabetes through automated insulin regulation.

## 🔬 Project Overview

This portfolio highlights the innovation and necessity of the artificial pancreas — a closed-loop medical device that combines continuous glucose monitoring, control algorithms, and insulin delivery systems to mimic the endocrine function of a healthy pancreas.
